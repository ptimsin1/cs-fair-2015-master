<div class="row judging-criteria">
    <div class="col-md-4">
<h3>Judging Teams</h3>
<p>This year each judge will be assigned to a team to judge a particular category. Each team of judges will be 
expected 
to 
look at all the projects for the category they have been assigned to picking the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 
3<sup>rd</sup> place winners for their category. Judging teams will be assigned the day of the fair at judge 
orientation 
before the fair starts.</p>

        <h3>Random Hourly</h3>
        Prizes are picked each hour via a PHP page that uses MySQL ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1. A winner will be selected for each hour block which includes 12:50 PM, 1:55 PM, and 3:00 PM. You must be present to claim your prize.
