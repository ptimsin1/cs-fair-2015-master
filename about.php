                            <p>
                                The CS Fair is a UVM event where Computer Science students (majors, minors or just taking a class) may submit and showcase their computer projects. The purpose of the CS Fair is to give students a chance to present their work to their peers and professionals in an open and exciting environment. A panel of judges critique the student work where the prize amounts are up to $1000 with many opportunities to win. This year the CS Fair will take place in the Davis Center in the Grand Maple Ballroom.

                                1st, 2nd, 3rd will be chosen based on a combination of the total number of student, staff, and faculty votes and a panel of judges. The judges will look at the total votes the project has received then compare that with their own findings to pick the winners.

                                Prizes are picked by a panel of judges for each category. Judges will vote for a first prize in their assigned category. The judges will pick the winners for this category. Student projects will be interspersed throughout the room but will be given a color code so a judge can easily identify which project to judge. There will be three different rounds of judging each hour for best in class but only one winner per class.
